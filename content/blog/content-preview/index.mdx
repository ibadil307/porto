**Paragraph**

I really like using Markdown.
I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

Headings by default:
# Heading level H1
## Heading level H2
### Heading level H3
#### Heading level H4

**Lists**

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

Unordered list:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

**Quote**
>True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing.

_Seneka_

**Syntax Highlightning**

```bash
npm i gatsby-theme-porto
```
